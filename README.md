### 🚀 Who Am I?

Hi, I'm **Davood Ya**, also known as **DavoodSec**, a passionate cybersecurity developer from Iran 🇮🇷.  
I specialize in creating **offensive security tools**, **custom C2 frameworks**, and **educational content** for ethical hacking and system defense.

> 💡 I believe the best way to **learn security is by building it from scratch.**
